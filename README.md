## Tools & Libraries Used

## What I Did

1. Loaded the housing dataset (`Housing.csv`)
2. Cleaned the data (converted 'yes'/'no' to numbers)
3. Used one-hot encoding for categorical columns
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Built a **Linear Regression** model
6. Predicted house prices on test data
7. Measured model accuracy using:
8. Plotted Actual vs Predicted prices
